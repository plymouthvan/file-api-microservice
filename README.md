# üìÅ File API Microservice

A lightweight, Dockerized file API for programmatic file and folder operations ‚Äî including upload, delete, rename, and optional public exposure of files and folders. Built specifically for no-code and low-code automation platforms (like n8n, Make, Zapier) that need simple file operations via HTTP without setting up complex object storage or cloud file managers.

## üéØ Purpose

This microservice provides a simple, self-hostable HTTP interface for managing files, especially for automation workflows that need to:
- Upload files and get public URLs back
- Organize files into folders
- Expose or hide folders as needed
- Perform basic file operations without proprietary lock-in
- Avoid bloated solutions when a lightweight API is sufficient

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/plymouthvan/file-api-microservice.git
cd file-api-microservice
```

### 2. Create a .env file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the .env file with your settings:
```
API_TOKEN=your_secure_token
PORT=3000
PUBLIC_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Build the Docker image
- Mount the `./public` directory to `/app/public` inside the container
- Expose the service on the specified port (default: 3000)
- Set up the API with your token and public URL

Your API is now running at http://localhost:3000 (or your specified port)!

## üîê Authentication

All modifying endpoints require a bearer token in the request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

## üí° Example Use Case

**Scenario**: Automation workflow needs to download a file and make it publicly accessible

1. **n8n or similar tool downloads a file** from an external source
2. **POST the file to this API**:
   ```javascript
   // Example HTTP Request node in n8n
   {
     "url": "http://localhost:3000/upload",
     "method": "POST",
     "headers": {
       "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN",
       "Content-Type": "application/json"
     },
     "body": {
       "folder": "customer-reports",
       "filename": "report-2025.pdf",
       "base64": "{{$node['Download_File'].data.base64}}",
       "mimetype": "application/pdf",
       "expose": true
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Receive a public URL** in the response:
   ```json
   {
     "status": "ok",
     "url": "https://yourdomain.com/public/customer-reports/report-2025.pdf",
     "...": "..."
   }
   ```
4. **Use the URL** in subsequent steps (email, webhook, etc.)

## üî§ Path & Naming Rules

When creating folders or uploading files, the following naming restrictions apply:

- **Allowed characters**: Only letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores
  - ‚úÖ `my-folder`, `project_123`, `reports2025`
- **Prohibited characters**: Spaces, dots, slashes, and special characters
  - ‚ùå `my folder`, `project.files`, `reports/2025`, `data$info`
- **URL safety**: Folder names are used in URLs, so they must be URL-safe
- **Error handling**: Invalid names will return a 400 status code with this error:
  ```json
  {
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Invalid folder name",
    "code": 400
  }
  ```

These restrictions are **intentional by design** to ensure consistent behavior across different operating systems and web environments. Since folder names become part of public URLs, they must follow URL-safe naming conventions.

## üõ† Roadmap Ideas

- Token management via config file or environment var
- Expiring links or TTL-based cleanup
- File size limits
- Disk usage stats
